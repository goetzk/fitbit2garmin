  ⬇ Downloads lifetime Fitbit data and exports it into the format supported by Garmin Connect data importer.
</p>


## Synopsis

This package provides a simple python CLI that allows people to download all
their Fitbit data into a format that is supported by Garmin Connect.

This includes:
 - historical body composition data (weight, BMI, and fat percentage);
 - activity data (calories burned, steps, distance, active minutes, and floors climbed);
 - individual GPS exercises (TCX).


Do you believe that this is *useful*?
Has it *saved you time*?
Or maybe you simply *like it*?  
If so, [support this work with a Star ⭐️][start].


## Privacy

The CLI runs on your computer and your data is only visible and accessible by
you. The CLI does not share nor send your data to third parties.


## Usage

1. Install the `fitbit2garmin` CLI using the following terminal command:
```bash
python -m pip install "fitbit2garmin@git+https://github.com/simonepri/fitbit2garmin"
```

2. Launch the following terminal command from a folder where you
want the data to be downloaded replacing `YYYY-MM` with year and month of when
you want the exported data to start from:
```bash
fitbit2garmin dump-all -s YYYY-MM-01
```

You will be prompted to authenticate to FitBit via OAuth in a web browser,
giving fitbit2garmin access to your account.
On the authentication screen you may see "Warning! This app is not using HTTPS
to securely obtain your permission", this is because fitbit2garmin redirects to
a webserver running on localhost - over http - after authentication succeeds.

https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Web-API-Development/quot-Warning-This-app-is-not-using-HTTPS-to-securely-obtain-your-permission/td-p/1317049

> Tip: The process will take several hours or even days depending on how many
        years of data you have. You can speed-up the process by adjusting the
        start/end date used by the script using the `-s YYYY-MM-DD` and
        `-e YYYY-MM-DD` flags.
        If fetching many years of activity it could take up to 10 minutes for
        this script to start displaying progress in the CLI.

> Tip: You can stop and resume the download at any time by just killing and
       re-running the above command. The CLI will continue automatically from
       where it left.

Files will be created in a 'f2g' subdirectory.


3. From [Garmin Connect][garmin:connect], log into your account then select the
import icon in the top right corner of the page (cloud with upward arrow icon).

4. Select Import Data.

5. Select Browse.

6. Locate and select the files exported by the CLI.

> Tip: I strongly recommend to upload up to 1 year of data at a time.

7. Select Import Data.

8. Select the units of measure that match what you used with Fitbit.

> Tip: If you mistakenly import a file using the wrong units of meaures, simply
       re-import it again. The Garmin Connect importer will replace old imported
       values automatically.

9. Select Continue.

> Tip: If the import for some file fails, try to refresh the page and re-import
       then again. The Garmin Importer is smart enough and you won't end-up with
       duplicated data if you import the same file twice.

10. Uninstall the `fitbit2garmin` CLI using the following terminal command:
```bash
python -m pip uninstall fitbit2garmin
```
